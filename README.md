Automated Multi-Window Signup Process for X (Twitter)
This project demonstrates an end-to-end automation of the X (Twitter) signup process using Selenium WebDriver with Java and TestNG. The automation script handles multi-window interactions, generates a temporary email, fills in user information, retrieves a verification code, and completes the signup process.
